    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A green bean casserole makes the Thanksgiving holiday complete, 
        and this version can be on the table in no time at all thanks to just four ingredients from your pantry or fridge: 
        canned green beans, condensed mushroom soup, French-fried onions, and shredded Cheddar cheese. 
        Tender green beans and crunchy onions in a creamy, cheesy sauce make this the best green bean casserole you'll ever make.
